### Project overview

The goal of this project is to establish relationships between the tables using the reatil data and use DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to enhance the dataset. The end objective is to create a high-level dashboard that provides various insights and allows for multiple views of the data.

### Data Loading

Import all four retail data files into the data model, ensuring that the headers contain the correct field names for each file.

### Data Cleansing

- Handling erros, missing values etc
- Remove/drop irrelevant records

### Relationship Management

Establish relationships between common columns in the tables.

### Data Enhancement with DAX

Perform calculations on the data using Data Analysis Expressions

### Update relationships

Review and update the relationships in the data model to ensure all tables are correctly connected.

### Analysis and Reporting

Perform various analyses and then segment the data by different dimensions such as month, week, weekday, product group, city, zone, and city tier.

### Dashboard Creation

Develop a comprehensive dashboard that visualizes the results from the analysis

### Key takeaways

- Dashboard provided a comprehensive view of the business performance, allowing users to drill down into specific details like sales by city, product group, or customer demographics.
- Adding time-related fields enabled the identification of sales trends based on the day of the week and the start of the week.
- The analysis provided critical insights, such as which city tiers and zones are driving the most revenue, where cancellations are highest, and how sales vary by day of the week.
